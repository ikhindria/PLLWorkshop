# 1. Introduction to PLL
Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is a control system which compares the frequency and phase of the on-chip oscillator with the reference signal and modifies the voltage of the oscillator in order to match the frequency of the oscillator with reference signal. PLL can be used to generate a signal of frequency equal to or multiple of the frequency of the reference signal. PLL reduces noise in the signal genrated by the oscillator.      
Some of the applications of PLL are for clock synchronization, in demodulation circuits and data converters.
